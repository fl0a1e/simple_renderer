## Summary


## Getting Started
Glitter has a single dependency: [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/download/), which is used to generate platform-specific makefiles or project files. Start by cloning this repository, making sure to pass the `--recursive` flag to grab all the dependencies. If you forgot, then you can `git submodule update --init` instead.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter
cd Glitter
cd Build
```

Now generate a project file or makefile for your platform. If you want to use a particular IDE, make sure it is installed; don't forget to set the Start-Up Project in Visual Studio or the Target in Xcode.

```bash
# UNIX Makefile
cmake ..

# Mac OSX
cmake -G "Xcode" ..

# Microsoft Windows
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14" ..
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" ..
...
```

If you compile and run, you should now be at the same point as the [Hello Window](http://www.learnopengl.com/#!Getting-started/Hello-Window) or [Context Creation](https://open.gl/context) sections of the tutorials. Open [main.cpp](https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter/blob/master/Glitter/Sources/main.cpp) on your computer and start writing code!

## Documentation
Many people overlook how frustrating it is to install dependencies, especially in environments lacking package managers or administrative privileges. For beginners, just getting set up properly set up can be a huge challenge. Glitter is meant to help you overcome that roadblock.

Glitter provides the most basic windowing example. It is a starting point, and tries very hard not to enforce any sort of directory structure. Feel free to edit the include paths in `CMakeLists.txt`. Glitter bundles most of the dependencies needed to implement a basic rendering engine. This includes:
